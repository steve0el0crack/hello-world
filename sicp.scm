;; In this tree (like in normal-order-evaluation), evaluations will be unnecessarily repeated... is it possible to prevent this? The book states that one answer is memoization/tabulation.

;; Programming Pascal's triangle (+- normal distribution) by means of a recursive process.

;;
;;                    1

;; Here I found a problem with the statement: Am I suposse to construct the complete triangle from a single recursive process?
;; In that case I couldn't solve the problem and maybe in the future with some more experience (after reading Knuth or a little bit more of mathematic) I would be able to come up with something!
;; But in order to apply the concepts explained in the chapter and make sense of this exercise, I searched for another approach to this problem in internet: Finding 1 number regarding its position in an imaginary "table"
