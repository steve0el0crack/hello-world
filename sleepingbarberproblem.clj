; Q. Calculate how many haircuts can be done in 10 seconds

        ;function would use a different thread each time called from this location. 
        ;However this function will not be called if the barber is already cutting hair. i.e.
        ;it is equivalent to waking the barber up.
        ;General clojure question, do the things backing a future need to be cleaned up? they hold onto
        ;their return value until dereferenced, so if never deference the return val, then what?

;To send the customers to the barber at different intervals
;we use the future macro, this will run the body passed to the
;macro in its own thread. I believe this macro is a wrapper around future-call
